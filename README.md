# Memory Game Project

This is a project from Udacity Front End Nanodegree, for studying purposes.

The Memory Game works basically the same way as any memory game: you try to match the pairs of images with as less moves as possible.
You start with 3 stars and, as you move, you can lose 1, 2 or all of your starts. The less moves, the more stars.
The game ends when all the pairs are matched.
When it's ended, your score will appear in your screen, then you can leave it or play again.
You can restart the game anytime you'd like.
